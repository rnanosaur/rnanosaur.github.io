To assembly nanosaur without any magnet, you can follow the same instruction on [Assemby](/assembly) taking care to to some extra steps for body and head.

You need extra screws (Check [Bill of Materials](/bill-of-materials#screw-set))

# Power Bank holder

Follow the same steps in [Motors block](/assembly/#motors-block) **WITHOUT** stick any magnet.

**:bulb: Hint** To simplify the assembly, **dry-fit** of all screws after 3D print
{: .notice--info}

The output will be like the picture below:

# Body

Follow the same steps in [Motors block](/assembly/#motors-block) **WITHOUT** stick any magnet.

**:bulb: Hint** To simplify the assembly, **dry-fit** of all screws after 3D print
{: .notice--info}

The output will be like the picture below:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/docs/screw_assembly/Body.png" alt="nanosaur body without magnets" caption="nanosaur body without magnets" %}

# Head 

Follow the same steps in [Head](/assembly#head) **WITHOUT** stick any magnet.

The output will be like the picture below:
{% include figure image_path="/assets/docs/screw_assembly/cover.png" alt="cover without magnets" caption="cover without magnets" %}

## Dry fit cover holes

The cover printed has for each side magnet hole another pilot drill hole to drive your M2 screw and make a hole on the cover. Screw it, like the picture below, to dry-fit for the Assembly step.

# Full Assembly

These steps are different compare the default assembly, take all screws and follow the instructions below.

## Assembly cover

| Quantity | Part                                    |
|:--------:|-----------------------------------------|
| 1        | [Body](#body)                           |
| 1        | [Head](#head)                           |
| 1        | Hex M2 14mm                             |
| 2        | Hex M2 6mm                              |

1. Screw two **Hex M2 6mm** on the cover side
2. Screw **Hex M2 14mm** from the rear part of nanosaur to the cover

The result will be like the picture below:

## Assembly power bank holder

| Quantity | Part                                    |
|:--------:|-----------------------------------------|
| 1        | [Body](#body)                           |
| 1        | [Power Bank holder](#power-bank-holder) |
| 2        | Hex M2 6mm                              |

Screw two **Hex M2 6mm** on the nanosaur tracks side to hold the power bank holder.

The result will be like the picture below:
