If you are here, you are ready to mount nanosaur!

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/collections/make/assembly/nanosaur-explode.png" alt="nanosaur explode view" caption="nanosaur explode view" %}

There are few steps to follow to mount nanosaur only using the tools in list, remember to collect and buy all components listed in the [Bill of Materials](/bill-of-materials)

We can split the nanosaur assembly into four parts:

* [Power Bank holder](#power-bank-holder)
* [Flap](#flap)
* [Body](#body)
* [Head](#head)

After mounts these three parts you can complete the nanosaur assembly.
You need only:

**:bulb: Hint** To simplify the assembly, **dry-fit** of all screws after 3D print

To assembly the flap, is relative simple, follow the pictures below, you need in the beginning soldering the [Expansion board](/expansion-board), when is done, you should follow these simple steps:

1. mount the flap covers on the nanosaur expansion board
2. Screwing the 4 screw and stable fix the cover on the expansion board
3. Pick your USB cable and pass it on the cover hole
4. Screw the cables on the connector (Hint: the positive is external. There is a little **(+)** print on the expansion board)

# Body

Now we are assembly the robot. We are ready to see finally Nanosaur riding on your desktop. These steps are simple to do and don't need a lot of time to do it.

## Motors block

To assembly the front Nanosaur block, you will need to follow only the steps in these pictures, where:

1. Assembly the magnets**
2. Take your two motors with [cable wired](/electronics#motor-wiring)
3. Assembly the sprocket on the wired motor
4. Pass for each motor cable on the slot
5. For each motor press to the rear housing and align the motor border to the frontal cover

{% include gallery id="motors" caption="Assembly front part" %}

When is done the result will be like the picture below. Where the two cables are out of the frontal holes.

{% include gallery id="motors-complete" caption="Assembly front part" %}
