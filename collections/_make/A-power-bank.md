Do you have already a power bank? maybe you don't need to buy a new one!

nanosaur works with a standard power bank, if your power bank support [Power Delivery](https://www.androidauthority.com/usb-power-delivery-806266/) will be great for future nanosaur release.

**:floppy_disk: Download** Download this the [**nanosaur-powerbank.pdf**](https://github.com/rnanosaur/nanosaur/releases/latest/download/nanosaur-powerbank.pdf) to check if your power bank fit the nanosaur slot.
