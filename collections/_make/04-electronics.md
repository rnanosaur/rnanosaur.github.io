In this page we will soldering the motor control and motors and will take a look of the Nanosaur wiring.

# Adafruit assembly

We should wire the [DC Motor + Stepper FeatherWing Add-on](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2927) following the picture below:

1. Soldering all XT connectors
2. Solder the electronic power at the end of the first row
3. Solder the I2C connector on the second row

The pinout of the [DC Motor + Stepper FeatherWing Add-on](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2927) will be the picture below

# Motor wiring

To soldering the motors you need to pay attention to the **(+)** symbol on the rear motor cover. You can wire the motors use a part of the 30cm flat ribbon cable that you use to assembly the [Nanosaur expansion board PCB](/expansion-board/#wiring-pcb)

| Symbol | Color   | Length  |
|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| +      | red     | 90mm    |
|        | brown   | 90mm    |

The motor will look like the last picture in this gallery

# Nanosaur wiring

The nanosaur expansion board connect the NVIDIA Jetson Nano to the Adafruit [DC Motor + Stepper FeatherWing Add-on](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2927) and two oled I2C Display 128x64px 0.96 inch. Following this bullet list

* I2C bus 0 (Pin 27, 28)
  * oled right
* I2C bus 1 (Pin 3, 5)
  * oled left
  * adafruit motor control
* 2 custom buttons
  * GPIO Pin 31
  * GPIO Pin 33

A schematic output has this output:
