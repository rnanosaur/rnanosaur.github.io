Before to move ahead working with nanosaur in simulation, if you did not do yet, follow the installation page. To enable your desktop to work with nanosaur.

{% include feature_row id="install" type="left" %}

If you follow the installation guide, we can start to configure your desktop to work with the simulator selected. At this time nanosaur can be simulated on:

* [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](/simulation/isaac-sim/)
* [Gazebo](/simulation/gazebo/)

You can use the simulation working with the simulators directly installed on your desktop, otherwise you can run everything in a docker container.

{% include feature_row id="tutorial" type="right" %}

With only two terminal and two commands you can switch on your simulation with nanosaur:

* First terminal:

{% capture code %}nanosaur simulation start{% endcapture %}{% include code.html code=code lang="sh" copyable=true %}

* Second terminal:

{% capture code %}nanosaur robot start{% endcapture %}{% include code.html code=code lang="sh" copyable=true %}

But how to configure your computer and how the simulators are working are explained in the next pages we setup the simulators from the `nanosaur-cli` and how to use them.
