Before to move ahead working with nanosaur in simulation, if you did not do yet, follow the installation page. To enable your desktop to work with nanosaur.

{% include feature_row id="install" type="left" %}

If you follow the installation guide, we can start to configure your desktop to work with the simulator selected. At this time nanosaur can be simulated on:

* [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim)
* [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org)

In the next pages we setup nanosaur to work on these simulator.
