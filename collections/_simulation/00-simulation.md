Before to move ahead working with nanosaur in simulation, if you did not do yet, follow the installation page. To enable your desktop to work with nanosaur.

{% include feature_row id="install" type="left" %}

If you follow the installation guide, we can start to configure your desktop to work with the simulator selected. At this time nanosaur can be simulated on:

* [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac/sim)
* [Gazebo](https://gazebosim.org)

You can use the simulation working with the simulators directly installed on your desktop, otherwise you can run everything in a docker container. 

{% include feature_row id="tutorial" type="right" %}

In the next pages we setup the simulators from the nanosaur-cli and how to use them.
