In this tutorial we start to use nanosaur, controlling by keyboard or joystick and visualize the output on screen.

With this basic tutorial you will be always able to control nanosaur in simulation or real, changing the configuration and test new feature.

This tutorial will teach you how to use the robot and how to use the command:

{% capture code %}nanosaur robot{% endcapture %}{% include code.html code=code lang="sh" copyable=true %}

{% include figure image_path="assets/images/collections/tutorial/nanosaur-robot.png" alt="nanosaur robot" caption="nanosaur robot command" %}

{% include feature_row id="simulation" type="left" %}

Follow the guide below to learn how to use the robot.

**:memo: Note** These commands are always available for every installation you choose.
