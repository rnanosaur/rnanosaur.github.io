NVIDIA Isaac GEMs for ROS provides a set of GPU-accelerated packages for your ROS 2 application, improving throughput on image processing and DNN-based perception models. These ROS 2 packages are built from ROS 2 Foxy, the first Long Stable Release (LTS) to come out of the robotics community.

This post investigates how you can accelerate your robotâ€™s deployment by implementing NVIDIA Isaac ROS GEMs. The focus of this post is AprilTags detection using nanosaur, a simple open-source robot based on the NVIDIA Jetson platform.
