🏫 Welcome the beginner course!

It's time to go to school and learn the ROS 2 fundamentals!
We start from basic commands and we build our the first ROS 2 package. This guide is along the lines of the [ROS 2 tutorial](https://docs.ros.org/en/{{ site.nanosaur.ros-distro }}/Tutorials.html) but with more details related to nanosaur.

If your robot is ready, powered on, it only time to develop with nanosaur, and start with the first chapter.
