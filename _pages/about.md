nanosaur is a simple **open-source** robot based on [NVIDIA Jetson](https://developer.nvidia.com/buy-jetson). The robot is fully 3D printable, able to wander on your desk autonomously and uses a simple camera and two OLEDs — these act as a pair of eyes. It measures a compact 10x12x6cm and it weighs only 500g.

🦕 **nanosaur** is proudly part of :pizza: [pizzarobotics](https://pizzarobotics.org) community
