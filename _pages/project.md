nanosaur is not a simple robot, but is designed like a real industrial robot, with a year develop roadmap, a develop workflow and a technical tagging release version.

# Roadmap

For rhe nanosaur roadmap 2022, will be defined and make stable all code for Isaac ROS, make a new nanosaur-shield to be able to use an NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX and finally enable all simulator Gazebo and Isaac SIM

# Workflow

This project follow an extended version of [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) where:

 * **main** branch record only stable release from the stable ros foxy branch
 * **ROS2** branches record progress for specific ROS2 repository (usually these branches are unstable)

# Tagging

nanosaur follow a code release tagging
