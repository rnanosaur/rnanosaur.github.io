{: .notice}

The expansion boars has size **20mm x 80mm** and have four M2 mounting holes, that perfectly fit inside the [Nanosaur flap](/assembly/#flap).

{% include gallery id="pcb_expansion_board_3d" caption="Nanosaur expansion board PCB" %}

This board is a simple adapter to connect the motor controller and the LCDs to the NVIDIA Jetson on your nanosaur, this board connect:

* I2C bus 0 (Pin 27, 28)
  * oled right
* I2C bus 1 (Pin 3, 5)
  * oled left
  * adafruit motor control
* 2 custom buttons
  * GPIO Pin 31
  * GPIO Pin 33

<!--
There are two ways to Assembly the expansion board:
 * [Nanosaur PCBs on PCBWay](#how-make-nanosaur-pcbs-on-pcbway) to support this project 
 * [Assembly with a matrix board](/option/assembly-matrix-board)
-->
# How make Nanosaur PCBs on PCBWay

* Register to PCBWay using [my refferer link](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=472567)
* Upon you registered, go to the <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Nanosaur___The_smallest_NVIDIA_Jetson_dinosaur_robot.html">nanosaur <img src="https://www.pcbway.com/project/img/images/frompcbway.png" alt="PCB from PCBWay" /></a>

# Components

The list of components that you need to have are in this table below

{% include kicad_bom.html table_name=site.data.nanosaur-exp-board %}

**:bulb: Hint** Reference [Table connectors](/bill-of-materials/#table-connectors)
{: .notice--info}

If you BoM have all components, like the picture below you are ready to assembly!

{% include figure image_path="/assets/docs/expansion-board/nanosaur-exp-board-components.jpg" alt="Nanosaur expansion board components" caption="Nanosaur expansion board components" %}

## Schematic

This expansion board is a simple connector for oleds and motor controller and works taking the power from the Power bank and power up the robot passing from a slide switch.

More detail are available on nanosaur expansion board schematic.

# Assembly PCB

To assembly the PCB, you need only a solder all [components](#components) and follow the steps on the gallery below.

1. Resistors
2. Switch
3. Terminal block 1x02
4. PinHeader 2x20

The PCB will be like the last picture of the gallery

{% include gallery id="pcb_expansion_steps" caption="Nanosaur expansion board assembly" %}

## Wiring PCB

To wire bring your 30cm flat ribbon cable 20P Rainbow IDC wire 1.27mm and split in 3 different wires:

| Quantity | Name          | Length  | Color code      |
|:--------:|---------------|---------|-----------------|
| 1        | Conn_motors   | 210mm   | brown -> blue   |
| 2        | Conn_i2c_oled | 300mm   | violet -> black |
| 2        | motor         | 90mm    | red & brown     |
| 1        | USB connector | 120mm   | black & red     |

{% include figure image_path="/assets/docs/expansion-board/nanosaur-exp-board-wire-01.png" alt="wire color schematic" caption="wire color schematic" %}

Now pay attention to wire in the right order the motor control cable **(Conn_motors)** where:

| Num | Color   | Connection                          | Type        |
|:---:|:-------:|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1   | brown   | spare                               | Motor (+)   |
| 2   | red     | spare                               | Motor (-)   |
| 3   | amber   | **2Pin**  Dupont connector          | SDA         |
| 4   | yellow  | **2Pin**  Dupont connector          | SCL         |
| 5   | green   | **3Pin**  Dupont connector **side** | VCC (+3.3V) |
| 6   | blue    | **3Pin**  Dupont connector **side** | GND         |

For the both display follow this table

| Num | Color   | Connection                          | Type        |
|:---:|:-------:|-------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1   | black   | **2Pin**  Dupont connector          | GND         |
| 2   | white   | **2Pin**  Dupont connector          | VCC (+3.3V) |
| 3   | grey    | **2Pin**  Dupont connector          | SCL         |
| 4   | violet  | **2Pin**  Dupont connector          | SDA         |

The wiring will be like the pictures below:

{% include gallery id="pcb_expansion_wiring" caption="Nanosaur wires" %}

To wire the expansion board follow the picture below, where:

| Plug | Name                    | Note                                   |
|:----:|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| J3   | Conn_i2c_oled **right** | **Violet** wire on squared hole (pin 1) |
| J4   | Conn_i2c_oled **left**  | **Violet** wire on squared hole (pin 1) |
| J5   | Conn_motors             | **Brown** wire on squared hole (pin 1) |

{% include figure image_path="/assets/docs/expansion-board/nanosaur-exp-board-wires-02.jpg" alt="Soldering wires on nanosaur expansion board" caption="Soldering wires on nanosaur expansion board" %}

When the soldering is done you will obtain nanosaur expansion board ready to be assembled on Nanosaur

{% include gallery id="wiring" caption="Nanosaur expansion board" %}

## Wiring USB connector

Last plug, last wiring! It's almost done.

Bring your **120mm wires red and black** and solder to the USB connector following the USB pinout below

{% include figure image_path="/assets/docs/expansion-board/USB.jpg" alt="USB pinout" caption="USB pinout" %}

Now wire the USB connector follow this table

| Num | Color   | Type        |
|:---:|:-------:|-------------|
| 1   | red     | +           |
| 2   | -       | D+          |
| 3   | -       | D-          |
| 4   | black   | -           |

And follow the pictures below to make your USB wire for the Nanosaur expansion board.

{% include gallery id="usb-connector" caption="USB connector wiring" %}

Add an heat shrink to insulate the wires and the connector will look like the picture below
